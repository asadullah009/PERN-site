Create a new Authication system for Users 

--Feature--

1 - User can register and login and see his profile and update his profile too.
2 - When a user logs in, I generate a token. Upon requesting user details, the system verifies the token validity before sending it to an HTTPS-only connection for authentication.
3 - When a user logs it clear the cookie.

--Git--
1 - "Feat: something that you added"
2 - "Fix: some bug that you fixed"
3 - "Chore: everything else"
